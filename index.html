                  <p>RESCUE ME GEORGIA is a 501c3 ALL VOLUNTEER non-profit rescue. RMG is foster based and oh, what a team we have ! NO ONE is paid - so every donations goes DIRECTLY to take care of the dogs we save.  PLEASE check us out at facebook.com/rescuemega to see what’s is happening daily!  We can’t do this without your support - thank you for sharing and caring and turning on friends to our rescue group.
                      Our ability to save more innocent lives hinges upon donations and volunteers.

                      We realize we can’t change a dog’s past, but with your support, we can certainly re-write his or her future!</p>
                    <p>App is wondering where everyone is?!?! Our dogs can provide immeasurable comfort as we make our way through these trying times so at RMG we are doing what we can to maintain some basic operations while balancing that with the safety and health of our volunteers and potential adopters. With that in mind, we are not allowing any out of state adoptions. Adoptions are restricted to the Metro Atlanta Area only.
                    </p>
                        <h3>WANT TO HELP? </h3>
                        
                        <p>Please consider making a tax-deductible donation to support our mission using our DONATE link. We are a licensed 501 c(3) nonprofit organization run entirely by volunteers, so all funds raised are applied directly to dogs in need. (All donations are tax-deductible to the fullest extent of the law.) Please review the links on our web site to see how you can become part of the RMG family.</p>

              <h1>Our AVAILABLE PETS</h1>
              <p>Make sure you use the scroll bar on the right to scroll all the way down! Your adoption saves three pets; the one you adopt, the one that gets to go to a foster home because you adopted, and the one that you have made room for in the shelter! That's maximizing your effort, don't you agree?

                  If you see someone you would like to get some more information about, please send us a message via the email address with the pet’s name included in the pet's description!  
                  
                  If you are interested in meeting or adopting one of our available pets, please first review their detailed profile to be sure they might be a good fit for you. Our volunteers take the time to get to know each individual pet prior to posting for adoption and include as many of their likes/dislikes and requirements in their profiles as possible. Our goal is to insure the best possible fit for everyone. If you meet the adoption requirements listed for the particular pet you are interested in, click the ADOPT button under their profile and fill out our adoption application.

                  FYI - We take the adoption of our dogs seriously - So many of our rescues have had lives on chains or living in outdoor pens and that's not allowed here. So if you are planning on your new family member living outside - we are NOT the rescue for you !
